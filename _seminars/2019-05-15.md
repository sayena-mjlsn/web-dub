title:      "Dancing with Robots: Designing Expression in Natural and Artificial Systems"

location:   "Kane 225"

abstract: |
  future, everything will move. As robots come out of the factory and into human-facing contexts, how will this movement change the way human-built environments feel? Will these changes make occupants feel like standing a busy street corner or sitting by a babbling brook? The Robotics, Automation, and Dance (RAD) Lab uses the theater, and live dance performance, as a place to begin to answer these questions about the effects of non-verbal motion on the human psyche. This talk will discuss activities in the performing arts and the design of robotic systems, particularly the motion of these systems. This work highlights how broadening the palette of available robotic motion may facilitate the design of spaces of the future. Critically, the talk will discuss the interrelationship between function and expression in movement, as explicated in the Laban/Bartenieff Movement System, which highlights the role of context in how humans make meaning from motion. As motivation, the talk will pull from applications including collaborative manufacturing robots, expressive bomb-defusal robots, office building energy monitors, and care-giving robots that help the elderly age-in-place. This talk is meant to provoke questions that will be further explored in a workshop on Thursday and presented in a more satisfying academic frame, offering some answers, in Friday’s Robotics Colloquium.

  Amy LaViers is an assistant professor in the Mechanical Science and Engineering Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and director of the Robotics, Automation, and Dance (RAD) Lab. She is a recipient of a 2015 DARPA Young Faculty Award (YFA) and 2017 Director’s Fellowship. Her teaching has been recognized on UIUC’s list of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students, with Outstanding distinction. Her choreography has been presented at the Merce Cunningham Dance Studio and in the DANCE NOW Joe’s Pub Festival at The Public Theater in New York City. She is a co-founder of two startup companies: AE Machines, Inc, an automation software company that won Product Design of the Year at the 4th Revolution Awards in Chicago and was a finalist for Robot of the Year at Station F in Paris, and caali, LLC, an embodied media company. She completed a two-year Certification in Movement Analysis (CMA) in 2016 at the Laban/Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies (LIMS). Prior to UIUC she held a position as an assistant professor in systems and information engineering at the University of Virginia. She completed her Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering at Georgia Tech with a dissertation that included a live performance exploring stylized motion. Her research began in her undergraduate thesis at Princeton University where she earned a certificate in dance and a degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering.
