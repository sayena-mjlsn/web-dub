title:      "SensEscapes: Learning and Making Public History in Mobile Collocated Interactions"

location:   "Kane 225"

abstract: |
  Mobile devices are antithetical to “promoting collaborative interaction in varied contexts” (CSCL Conference Theme, 2019), or so recent news stories would have us believe (e.g., Bowles, 2018). Those tiny screens inhibit a shared gaze on activity, distance users from the places they inhabit, and immobilize bodies to statues posed with heads down, hands gripping edges of a phone. So designing “collocated interaction” (Fischer et al., 2018), or copresent technology use toward a shared objective, seems like a lost cause.
  It is within this design space that my research team and I offer a more nuanced, perhaps optimistic, version of mobile collocated interaction for teaching and learning public history in an undergraduate course. While our designed activity, that we call “SensEscapes,” encountered the kinds of obstacles to collaboration mentioned above, we also saw openings for novel relationships between bodies, local histories, places, and tools. These openings, we argue, are untenable when seated at a desk, in a classroom, and without a mobile device in hand. Our design of SensEscapes is guided by theories of embodied learning (e.g., Lindgren & Johnson-Goldberg, 2013) and learning on the move (e.g., Taylor & Hall, 2013). SensEscapes invited students to engage their senses (ie., smell, sight, hearing, touch) for learning about the neighborhood surrounding their public university, and the histories that moved institution and community together and apart over time. Small groups of approximately five students used a mobile mapping application, Siftr ™, to find locations within a six-block area, read a short history about each location, then create a geotagged digital artifact at each spot. Siftr allowed for student groups to encounter past histories and document multi-sensory experiences using (analog and digital) mobile tools. 
  In our analysis of video records of student participation during SensEscapes, we found that mobile collocated interaction took the form of static collaboration. By static collaboration we mean that the typical social cues of “good” collaboration upon which the learning sciences place high value—gestures, shared eye gaze, touching and pointing to the same representation—were absent. However, evidence of effective and high levels of collaboration took other forms. Students achieved focused interactions (e.g., Goffman, 1963) largely without looking at one another or seeing the same thing at the same time. Using more typical qualities of collaboration from an interaction analysis frame, students’ participation in SensEscapes looked divorced from place and one another because of the mobile devices. Yet, we knew from students' reflections after the activity that learning and engagement were high. We re-situated our analytic lens to the context; by paying close attention to convergent talk and device use, and postural tuning to allow for quick glances to a neighbor’s screen, it was evident the mobile device set up micro-mobilities (Luff & Heath, 1998) important for building shared understandings of the place, on the move. Still, our findings also point toward redesigns in both the mobile application and the overall activity that diminish the time spent in the digital world and increase time spent with the landscape.
